	<h1>Statement</h1>
		<p>The first thought I had when I was going into this was how can I make this as tropical looking as I can? However, the more I thought about it, the less authentic it would be to Nayarit. My family is from Nayarit MX, and I have been plenty of times. The first color that came to mind when I think of Nayarit is a nice cream white. Almost all of the houses and buildings have that warm white color, so I felt it was only right I used that color as the main background. Sticking with the cream white background, I wanted another color that stood out well with the cream white. Dark green did the trick and represents the green mountains within Nayarit.</p>

		<p>As for placement, in the index.html, I wanted to put a large "Visit Nayarit" with the buttons immediately underneath it. I always enjoy the look of a website with the buttons and links at the top of the screen. I wanted to put a large image right underneath of something outstanding in Nayarit. After about 15 minutes of searching for things to put, I eventually decided on the "Playa Escondida".</p>
