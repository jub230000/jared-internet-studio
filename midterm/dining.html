    <p>Looking for good mariscos in the San Blas area? Look no further than Mr. Camaron! If there is any dish that can be prepared with shrimp, Mr. Camaron will have it. Shrimp coctails, ceviche, grilled fish, you name it! They have large tables, so if you come with a group or a large family, they will easily have you seated. No reservation required!</p>

    <h1>2. Fonda Juanita</h1>
    <img src="./images/juanita.webp" height="350px">
    <p>Good tradition Mexican food at an insanely reasonable price. Fonda Juanita is a great place to get exceptional quality breakfast food without breaking the bank. The servers here treat you like one of their own and will get you whatever you need. Does usually get real busy during opening hours (8-10 AM) but there is plenty of seating, so if you do have to wait, it will not be for long. The Carne Con Chile and Cafe de Olla comes especially reccomended. </p>

    <h1>3. Mercado Municipal</h1>
    <img src="./images/mercado.jpg" height="350px">
    <p>In the heart of Ixtlan Del Rio, the municipal market offers anything from menudo, tortas, (known as lonches in the local area) chicharrones, and much more! Open every morning at around 8 am, the tortas are especially sought after. The restaurants are inside the larger the building, but once you are inside, you have many options. The food is great here and the service is phenomenal. The Lonches de Pierna are reccomended.</p>
