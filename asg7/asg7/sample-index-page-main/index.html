		<p>Thundercat is an American producer/bassist/artist born October 19, 1984. He is most known for his solo projects involving his ridiculous 6 string bass. He also played with the iconic Suicidal Tendencies for a little while before going solo with his R&B/funk. (It is hard to define his music, you would have to listen to it yourself)</p>
	<h3>Why would he make a good ruler?</h3>
		<p>First and foremost, his personality. Thundercat is one of the coolest artists to me. He is a huge anime fan, even putting Asuka Langley from Neon Genesis Evangelion on his 6 string bass. Secondly, if anybody could play the bass, let alone A SIX STRING BASS, like he does; I would immediately support them politically.</p>
