	<h2>Domain Name Discussion</h2>
		<p>	I brought my list of domain names up to Procter (Sophia) to discuss eachother's domain names in a sort of trade deal. First thing she mentioned was that she thought jarbenaudio.com was the best option as it was shorter than the first option and is more professional sounding than the third option. Chanoduh is also my instagram handle/gamertag on platforms. With this in mind I basically removed chanoduh from the main contenders. While my full name is not too bad, it does not provide any clues as to what my page is really for.</p>
