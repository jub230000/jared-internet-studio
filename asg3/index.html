  <h2>Readings Questions</h2>

  <h3>Violation of rule number 6 (Clickable element that is not obvious)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://reverb.com/">Reverb.com</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>I chose this website because the giant banner seems clickable, but is not clickable whatsoever. There are elements within it that ARE clickable, but it makes it confusing.</p>

  <h3>How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.</h3>

    <p>Framing your project in a story format can help refine your ideas by giving the audience an emotional reaction to your project/ideas. Giving your project/ideas a story allows people to engage with it and start an emotional connection with it. Many modern day designers utilize stories in their projects. Creating stories also helps teams visualize and work towards the same goal. It is almost like a language that the team can speak with eachother. By framing the ideas and issues the project is for, you put your team into the right mindset.</p>

  <h3>What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.</h3>

    <p>One way to establish hierarchy in typography design is size. A bigger font size typically grabs your attention first. Another is the font style. The font style creates clear distinction between a header and a paragraph. One more way to create a hierarchy is space and placement. You can create clear seperation in hierarchy by simply having a header a line or 2 above the paragraph.</p>

  <h2>Creative Brief</h2>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Not having a readily available portfolio for my sound design/audio production projects. There are conventional ways to post my works online, however having a dedicated online portfolio would work best as it can be 100% arranged how I want it.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audience would be any potential employers and clients. Having a dedicated portfolio would allow for them to look over my experience and work ethic. It would also give a brief introduction to me as an individual, as most careers in audio are based on likeability of the individual.</p>

    <h3>Competition</h3>
      <p>The main and direct competition would be other audio engineers/producers within my local area or simply others with similar or more experience.</p>

    <h3>Key Messages</h3>
      <p>To provide the best of my talent and experience in audio to any client or project, in any way or manner the project/client needs it.</p>

    <h3>Call To Action</h3>
      <p>Take advantage and leave an email today! Even if it isn't to book, I would love to chat! I am avaiable and very experienced in ProTools and FL Studio!</p>

    <h3>How To Measure Success</h3>
      <p>Success of the online portfolio would not necessarily at first be to secure jobs and/or projects, but to mostly grab the attention of people. I want to make sure I stand out and provide something unique from other audio engineers.</p>
