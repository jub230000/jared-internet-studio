<h2> This is the sub heading</h2>
<img src="img/titlefight.jpg">
	<p>Title Fight is my favorite band currently as it is such an expressive band in a relatively strict sub-genre. Hardcore is known to be heavy, loud, and for outside listeners, "mean". Title Fight challenges typical hardcore punk rock by incorporating relatable lyrics and non hardcore typical guitar riffs. They also utilize multiple guitar pedal effects in their music, which gives it a wall of sound feel to it. Very similar to shoegaze, and they may even draw inspiration from shoegaze. I currently own copies of their albums "Shed" and "Floral Green" on CD and constantly play them in my car. They curently are on an indefinite hiatus and have not played a show sinc 2018. This makes me super depressed.</p>
