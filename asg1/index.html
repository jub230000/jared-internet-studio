	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>3 Things I learned from week 1 readings</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML is the most basic yet most vital language in web design</li>
<li>Individuals may soon come to own their own data on the web during the Web 3.0 stage and above</li>
<li>Web 1.0 was almost strictly read only</li>
</ul>

<h2>Semester Project</h2>
<p>For my semester project, I was thinking of creating a website that can serve as a portfolio. 
	It does not necessarily have to be the professional portfolio that I will use for the rest of my life, but something to help me understand how to create my own website portfolio. I feel like this could serve me well as I am in a creative field (audio production) and having the experience would be great!
	 I will have to incorporate videos, images, and audio clips into my website.</p>
