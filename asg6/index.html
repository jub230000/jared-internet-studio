	<h1>Six Hats</h1>
		<p>I brought up my portfolio idea to my good friend Kellen, who is also an audio producer. He and I used the ideas of the Six Hats to discuss my idea and its potential ups and downs.</p>

	<h2>White Hat</h2>
		<p>For the white hat section, I first started by saying about what I was already planning to include in the portfolio. An "about me" page, professional and nonprofessional experience, sample audio clips, contact information, images, and general info on my work/experience. One thing that I did felt was missing from my plan was qualifications. I need to put on my portfolio about my ability with software/hardware. Kellen also pointed out that he felt like it needs something to help me stand out, as everything I had stated before was essentially about what every other producer has. Perhaps design and maybe fun facts could help with this. </p>
	
	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
		<p>I feel a bit nervous about others perception of me from this. I do not want to come across as over-confident, more so just reliable. I feel like I have good ideas regarding design and am fairly confident in my works. Kellen mostly boosted my confidence on my works, as usually I work on music projects with him.</p>

	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
		<p>The first thing that I at first brought up as a potential problem was my "about me" page idea. As much as I would like people to know more about me, I think I need to keep it to a minimum. I will not be hired based on my background. Another thing that could potentially be an issue has to do with the overall idea of the portfolio. Most of the times, projects will come to us if a friend wants something specifically. For example, in the coming few semesters I am going to produce music for some of my friends and my personal band. So I feel even after having a portfolio it may not be of much help.</p>

	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
		<p>While most of my projects come from word of mouth among my friends and their friends, I think this could be a potential boost. In our discussion, I mentioned that I feel if my friends wanted to reccomend me, instead of having them immediately talk to me or introduce themselves in person, they could look at a proper portfolio and see what I can do for them. Kellen agreed with me on this, and mentioned that it could help for networking purposes. One thing I thought of putting front and center were the audio clips I mentioned before, but make sure they are different audios. So for example, I can use an indie rock track, a djent metal track, an ambient background with SFX, and other various audio clips to show my flexibility. Kellen especially liked this idea.</p>
